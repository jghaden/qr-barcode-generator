# Description

I had previous experience building an API such as my [**MEAN Template**](https://github.com/jghaden/mean-template), but I wanted to experiment more by working with API keys and secrets. As of right now, the API Key is generated by [**jsonwebtoken**](https://www.npmjs.com/package/jsonwebtoken) for the sake of easy verification and the API secret is a alphanumeric string generated by [**randomstring**](https://www.npmjs.com/package/randomstring).

# Requirements

This application requires installation of [**NodeJS**](https://nodejs.org/) prior to running.

# Installation
```
$ npm install
```

## Start server

If you wish to have [**nodemon**](https://www.npmjs.com/package/nodemon) watch your code changes, run:

```
$ npm dev
```

or if you wish to simplay start the server only with Node (such as a deployed application), run:

```
$ npm start
```

# Running

### Generate API key and secret by providing a username

### Leaving the API Key and Secret blank will use default values

### Or, you can enter your own API key and Secret to generate a barcode or QR code
